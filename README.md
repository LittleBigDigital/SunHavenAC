# Stardew Valley Animation Cancelling for macOS

## Before running

Add this application to System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Accessibility, as it requires control behaviour of input devices.

## How to use

1. Middle mouse (scrollwheel, or "button 3") click will perform a left mouse button click, followed by a 200ms pause, then the animiation cancel routine (R + RightShift + Delete).
2. Holding the middle mouse down will re-trigger the behaviour repeatedly (left click, 200ms pause, R + RightShift + Delete) until it is released.
3. A slider allows precise setting of a millisecond pause between trigger and animation cancel key sequence
4. Option to specify a trigger of any keyboard key (except Esc) or mouse button (except left click) and will capture modifier key states also (Ctrl, CMD, Option & Shift)
